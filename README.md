This app is just for the sake of my portfolio to showcase my iOS app development skills.

What's done so far:

- Integrated Alamofire for making HTTP requests.
- Implemented a public api that return's a list of movies.
- Implemented UICollectionView and populated it with the list of movies.
- Created a controller with movie details i.e Title, Thumb and description.
- On didTap, opened the movie detail controller and populated the data of that specific item tapped.
